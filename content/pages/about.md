Iâ€™m just your average JOE (JapOnaisE) with a pinch of Aussie accent living in Sydney.

I'm an engineering grad (Mechatronics Eng/Comp Sci @UNSW), was a "Corporate" embedded software dev for a niche field of Wi-Fi embedded system for 3 months, until I found my place in a robotic manipulator company to work on a project funded by Australian space-grant.

Hopefully I get to explore number of personal projects that belong in a museum some day (when Iâ€™m in/famous) - at the moment I have a grave yard of autons, so Iâ€™m just looking to complete projects that actually workâ€¦ Or revive them, Franken-style.

All in all, I enjoy plant growing, bouldering, baking, and all things learning and creating.
