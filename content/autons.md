The year of 2022 is coming to a relieving "pandemic-free" end for us in Sydney. As common folks do, I started to curate my list of "New Year's resolution". (Re)attempt to starting a blog came up on the list, so I figured, why not get started?

# What the Auton?
(Spoiler alert: No it's not related to creepy robot manekins)

The meaning of the term ‚Äúrobot‚Äù is little grim - ‚Äúforced labour‚Äù (robota) in Slavic - with a linguistic root "rab" meaning "slave".

I grew up in Japan so naturally I was surrounded by robotic characters and dreams that robots will one day become, in a broad sense, our companion. Would you call your friends "slaves"? Just as the history taught us, there were eras (and unfortunately still are) of humanity where we have direspected and mistreated each other, and living things. Besides the debate of "robots will have become one of us" or "robots will have the same rights as us", my personal perference would be to treat everything/everyone right in the ways I can.

Long story short, that's why I prefer to call autonomous machines as ‚Äúautomaton/s‚Äù, meaning ‚Äúacting of itself‚Äù in Latin. I would want my electro-mechanical dogs to do its own thing, rather than being a personal robotic slave that cleans my floor precisely when it's been told (and failing to do so anyway).

# Au revoir 2022 - Though we will not meet again
With a day or two left in the 22', seems like an opportune time for an annual self-reflection i.e. trying to remember what I did this year.

<br />
A lot happened actually.
<br /><br />

By the end of 2021, I completed my 5-year engineering and computer science degree, and received a bridging visa for my graduate visa, so I can work in Australia (at least a little while longer).

Started my first full-time "Corporate job", writing software for a niche field of Wi-Fi embedded system, until 3 months later, I found my place in a robotic manipulator company to work on a project funded by Australian space-grant.

<br />
I streched my brains out daily, I'll be honest.
<br /><br />

But I got to meet many smart & enthusiastic people, working in a company that centers around learning/shifting/agile-ing, not obeying to the status-quo and trying to do the right thing in many ways. Lots of respect for my fellow workers.

Regarding my personal endevours: I had my graduation ceremony with my family attending, went camping in the snow with absolute worst weather, got introduced to bouldering (cool activity, I now go weekly), went home to Japan for the first time since the start of pandemic, moved out to an apartment by myself, received my graduate visa, and (so far) successful bread baking (milk-breads! üçû).

## 2022 Career Wrap-up

* First full-time job!
* Worked a "Corporate job", a.k.a "9-5".
* Witnessed 50,000 line C code üí©
* Witnessed a gigantus C-function that took > 25 arguments ü¶ï
* Also witnessed pretty cool implementation of Open-Closed principle in C
* Second full-time job!
* Learnt how robotic manipulator is actually made!
* Also manufactured some robotic arm components myself (Been out in the field for some time now, I hope they don't return for RMA soon ...)
* Space-engineering 101, like thermal mathematical models, orbital dynamics, risk analysis, vaccum effects, multilayer insulation (MLI) ...
* 3rd party test planning, telemetry data acquisition and analysis e.g. for thermal vacuum chamber, radiation chamber ...
* Learnt the existance of Rust-lang
* Safety-critical standards and principles for embedded software
* Building interpersonal relationship with fellow workers
